A library for reading social data from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) using Spark Streaming.

[![Travis CI status](https://api.travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/streaming-facebook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/streaming-facebook)

## Usage example ##

Run a demo via:

```sh
# set up all the requisite environment variables
export FACEBOOK_APP_ID="..."
export FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET="..."
export FACEBOOK_AUTH_TOKEN="..."

# compile scala, run tests, build fat jar
sbt assembly

# run locally
java -cp target/scala-2.11/streaming-facebook-assembly-0.0.1.jar FacebookDemo standalone

# run on spark
spark-submit --class FacebookDemo --master local[2] target/scala-2.11/streaming-facebook-assembly-0.0.1.jar spark
```

## How does it work? ##

Facebook doesn't expose a firehose API so we resort to polling. The FacebookReceiver pings the Facebook API every few
seconds and pushes any new posts into Spark Streaming for further processing.

Currently, the following ways to read images are supported:
- by page ([sample data](https://www.facebook.com/pg/aljazeera/posts/))
